# Forestcopter

The main objective of creating an application-based drone is to introduce the tech world and tech community to head towards advantageous approach of saving a life with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), conserve time and a huge involvement of precise automated machines that can be created with the fundamental knowledge of computer science, electrical/electronic, and mechanics.

Deployed a drone into the forest sector so that it can come handy for the Forest Rescue Department. Thus following were the features that were customized into it:

- Camera Surveillance using Raspberry Pi
- Calling system using GSM Module
- Forest Fire prediction system
